Automatic Shutdown Scheduler is a simpleÂ program I made to create the recurring shutdown task in Windows for you.

Use the config file to specify time of a shutdown (hour, minute, second).
To remove the shutdown task set the key="removeShutdown" and value="true".

To abort the immediate shutdown open cmd and type "shutdown /a".
